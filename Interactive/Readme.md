## Lights and Shaders
The three objects in this projects uses 2 lightings, one shining at the front and one at the back. By tweaking and experimenting on the lights and shaders settings resulted in final look of the objects
### Snorlax
The Snorlax object initially showcased a bright appearance with well balanced lighting parameters: ambient intensity set to (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), diffusion intensity at (0.9, 0.9, 0.5), and a specular constant of (0.9, 0.9, 0.5). Modifications to these settings—adjusting ambient intensity to (0.5, 0.5, 0.4), diffusion intensity to (0.8, 0.8, 0.6), and specular constant to (0.9, 0.8, 0.6), while reducing the ka value from 1.0 to 0.4 result in a warmer, softer visual effect, significantly enhancing the model's overall aesthetic appeal.
### Voltorb
The Voltorb object initially featured bright lighting settings similar to the Snorlax model, with ambient intensity at (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), diffusion intensity at (0.9, 0.9, 0.5), and a specular constant of (0.9, 0.9, 0.5). By adjusting these parameters setting ambient intensity to (0.45, 0.45, 0.4), diffusion intensity to (0.6, 0.6, 0.5), and the specular constant to (0.6, 0.6, 0.55), along with lowering the ka value from 1.0 to 0.7 produces a clearer, warmer appearance, enhancing the model's overall refinement and polished look.
### Pikachu
Pikachu’s initial settings were also bright, with an ambient intensity of (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), diffusion intensity of (0.9, 0.9, 0.5), and a specular constant of (0.9, 0.9, 0.5). Adjustments to the ambient intensity to (0.45, 0.45, 0.4), diffusion intensity to (0.6, 0.6, 0.5), and specular constant to (0.6, 0.6, 0.55), combined with lowering the ka value from 1.0 to 0.7, resulted in a warmer and clearer appearance.
