# Rendering Process

## Snorlax (Adam)

### Modelling
There were multiple shapes during the modelling process to represent different body parts of Snorlax and I've used a blueprint from Dimension in order to get the idea of what 3D Snorlax looks like

**Head and Body** - For head and body, I have initially started with a cube and apply subdivision surface in order for the object to have smoother appearances. Afterwards, I've scaled the object to roughly the size of the head and body of Snorlax. After the scaling part, I've went to the sculpting mode and use the Grab tool and grab the object to follow the outline of the blueprint in order to get the shape of the body and head.

**Arms, Feet and Ears** - For this part, initially I have also started with a cube and applied subdivision surface. Afterwards, I have applied a mirror modifier to the Y axis (for ears it's to the Head while for the feet and arms is to the Body) in order to reduce the amount of tasks and keep the objects consistent. Afterwards, I extruded, scaled, and rotated the object accordingly to make it a rough shape of what the object supposed to look like before using Grab in sculpting mode in order to match it to the outline of the blueprint.

**Toes and Fingers** - For this part, instead of a cube, I've used a cone as it represents the object more accurately. Similarly, I also extruded, scaled and rotate the object and place it by the other object (fingers with arms, and toes with feet). However, I didn't follow the blueprint as I transform and rotate it based on what I want it to look like.

**Eyes and Mouth** - For this part, I've used a bezier curve and draw the shape following the blueprint.
