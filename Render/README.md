# Rendering Process

## Snorlax (Adam)

### Modelling
There were multiple shapes during the modelling process to represent different body parts of Snorlax and I've used a blueprint from Dimension in order to get the idea of what 3D Snorlax looks like

**Head and Body** - For head and body, I have initially started with a cube and apply subdivision surface in order for the object to have smoother appearances. Afterwards, I've scaled the object to roughly the size of the head and body of Snorlax. After the scaling part, I've went to the sculpting mode and use the Grab tool and grab the object to follow the outline of the blueprint in order to get the shape of the body and head.

**Arms, Feet and Ears** - For this part, initially I have also started with a cube and applied subdivision surface. Afterwards, I have applied a mirror modifier to the Y axis (for ears it's to the Head while for the feet and arms is to the Body) in order to reduce the amount of tasks and keep the objects consistent. Afterwards, I extruded, scaled, and rotated the object accordingly to make it a rough shape of what the object supposed to look like before using Grab in sculpting mode in order to match it to the outline of the blueprint.

**Toes and Fingers** - For this part, instead of a cube, I've used a cone as it represents the object more accurately. Similarly, I also extruded, scaled and rotate the object and place it by the other object (fingers with arms, and toes with feet). However, I didn't follow the blueprint as I transform and rotate it based on what I want it to look like.

**Eyes and Mouth** - For this part, I've used a bezier curve and draw the shape according to the blueprint. Afterwards, I "attached" it to the head of the Snorlax and joined it with the head.

**Teeth** - For this part, I have added a circle object, and changed the vertices to 3 to make a triangle. Afterwards, I've copied and paste the object to create 2 teeths and paste it accordingly to the mouth.

Afterwards, I've joined all the shapes together to create a single Snorlax object.

### Materials

I will split these between what colour I have used or different techniques.

**Arms and Ears** - I set the RGB colour to (41,115,142) to match the blue colour of snorlax.

**Head and Body** = I have used texture paint and draw the inside of the body and face to white and the outside of it to the blue colour, same as the RGB of what I have used for arms and ears.

**Feet** - I have set the colour to RGB (241,229,215) to have a beige colour.

**Toes and Fingers** - I have set the colour to white to have a slight contrast to the color of the feet.
